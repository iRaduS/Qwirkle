Qwirkle Calculator
---

This project was made for the Computer Vision course and represents a Qwirkle score calculator. To start this project please install first the
dependencies that are inside the ```requirements.txt``` file using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. The Python version must be 3.11.

Create a new directory called ```datasets```. Inside this directory you will unzip the contents of the .zip files for the templates. Each .zip archive should have its own folder where the templates
are. (i.e. ```bonus_templates.zip``` must be found inside ```/datasets/bonus_templates/*.jpg```).

Afterwards run ```cp .env.example .env``` to create the local environment file and also please change the paths accordingly via the .env file or by modifying the code.
For the output files you need to pass the parameter which is configurable.
